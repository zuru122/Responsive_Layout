## Author: SUNDAY, JUSTICE GABRIEL 
After studying the course materials, I did the challenges too

The simple web page contains three sections
The first section, which is the hero section contains h1, p, btn
the Last two sections containss a  flex-items which each has h2, p and are
text-aligned to center.

This solution is subjectto change because I willeven makke  it more responsive on mobile when I learn media query
